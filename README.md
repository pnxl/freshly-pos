# Handel

This is Handel - a simple, configurable point-of-sale app; for small temporary shops/sales.

### What applications can it be used for?

Handel can be applied to a lot of scenarios, such as..

- Garage sales (can be used to keep track of prices and inventory\*)
- Pop-up shops (maybe something temporary, like selling lemonade at the side of the street)
- School projects (something like 'Entrepreneurship Day' where you sell goods)

* feature coming soon!

### What's the catch?

Handel doesn't take payments - instead having you handle the payments manually. This is perfect for small temporary shops, where obtaining a payment terminal or a real register isn't viable.

## How do I use it?
